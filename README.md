## Build
---
### Dependencies
- CMake (min version 3.1)
- GoogleTest (Optinal)
- Doxygen (Optional)
- Graphviz (Optional)

### How to Install Dependencies
---
```bash
$ sudo apt install cmake libgtest-dev doxygen graphviz
```

### How to Build
---
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
$ make
```

You can use different [CMake Generators](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html) as well.

### Build Options
---
There are build options to build Google Test tests, generate Doxygen documents and generate dependency graph with Graphviz.
All options are OFF in default but the desired option can be turned on by setting it ON in the build command.

```bash
$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" .. -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -DGENERATE_DOCS=ON -GENERATE_GRAPH=ON 
```

### How to Run Application
---
```bash
$ cd build
$ ./bin/Application
```

## Test
---
### How to Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests (make sure it is verbose, otherwise CLITest cannot print options on the console)
$ cd build
$ cd test
$ ctest --verbose
```
```bash
# Run all tests individually
$ cd build
$ cd bin
$ ./CLITest
$ ./UserDBTest
```

## Documentation
---
Documents are generated from javadoc style written comments by using Doxygen. 
You can find the docs at below location after the build step if you turned on GENERATE_DOCS build option.
```bash
build/html/index.html
```

Dependency graph generated by Graphviz can be found below after the build step if you turned on GENERATE_GRAPH build option.
```bash
build/dependencyGraph.png
```

Also it can be found in if you don't prefer to generate it:
```bash
docs/dependencyGraph.png
```
